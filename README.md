## Matteo Merola

I'm currently a [tech lead](https://linkedin.com/in/matteomerola) at [KLM](https://www.klm.com), working on turning [airline operations](https://airlineoperations.ai) into a competitive advantage ([watch](https://youtu.be/Tkn0Q-lkTP0)).

Previously, I stated a [digital company](https://datasound.it), led the development team in an [edutech startup](https://corsi.it), wrote [open source software](https://www.github.com/mattmezza) and collaborated with many companies in areas such as [fintech](https://bunq.com), and [greentech](https://cleaopa.de).

I occasionally write [some articles](https://matteo.merola.co/articles) and rarely [tweet](https://twitter.com/_mattmezza_).
