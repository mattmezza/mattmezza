## Matteo Merola

I'm currently building [SaaS products[(https://saaskoala.com) such as [ZenLeadr](https://zenleadr.com/?utm_src=matteo.merola.co) that help people and businesses succeed.

[ZenLeadr](https://zenleadr.com/?utm_src=matteo.merola.co) is a toolkit designed for engineering managers and leaders.

Previously, I was an [Engineering Lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteomerola/) at [Shell](https://shell.com), where I was leading +40 engineers building the operating system for the trade and supply business. Before that, I was a [tech lead](https://linkedin.com/in/matteomerola) at [KLM](https://www.klm.com), working on turning [airline operations](https://airlineoperations.ai) into a competitive advantage ([watch â†—](https://youtu.be/Tkn0Q-lkTP0)).

I've also started a [digital company](https://datasound.it), led the development team in an [edutech startup](https://corsi.it), wrote [open source software](https://www.github.com/mattmezza) and collaborated with many companies in areas such as [fintech](https://bunq.com), and [greentech](https://cleaopa.de).

I occasionally write [articles](https://matteo.merola.co/articles) and sometimes [I tweet](https://twitter.com/_mattmezza_).
